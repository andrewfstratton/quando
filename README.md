# Quando - Visual Programming for Digital Interactive Exhibits

## What is Quando?

Quando looks similar to the Scratch 'block' editor often used for learning to program, or for end user development.

However, Quando does not use standard programming concepts and **does not expect users to learn to program** and is aimed at End User Development.

## Who is Quando for?

Quando is aimed at end users and domain experts wishing to create and edit digital interactions without having to become programmers.

## What can Quando do?

The main benefits of Quando are:

- **Very quick** creation of simple (i.e. not deep, but typically shallow) interactions
- **Exploring** different interaction options and choosing between different options quickly
- **Discovering** different ways to interact and **learning** about different inputs and outputs and how they work for (other) users

## What types of inputs are available?

Quando allows many different inputs (and more are being added), including:

- Leap Motion hand movement in 3 dimensions and rotation in 3 'angles' (six degrees of freedom)
- Mouse and Keyboard
- micro:bit keys, orientation and (version 2 only) touch
- Gamepad input (from browser)
- (experimental) EEG headset
- (experimental) speech recognition

## What types of output are available?

Some of these outputs also include inputs:

- digital media - images, video, audio and (experimental) sound waves
- (in progess) 3d object/scene
- (experimental) Augmented Reality
- Speech
- Control of (local PC) mouse and keyboard
- (experimental) Nao Robot control including full movement, speech, etc.
- (experimental) microbit servo contol and esp32 (display)

## What can Quando be used for?

Quando has been used for:

- interactive exhibits for museums, typically using the touchless Leap motion controller to interact with information displays
- touchless interactive control of robots to aid understanding of robot abilites
- 

## Why is it called Quando?

The name Quando comes from Latin for 'when' since Quando use a When based approach to describing behaviour rather than an if based approach. 

# Installing Quando 

Quando can currently be installed:

- locally - please [see these instructions](./docs/install_local.md).  You should only need to do this once.

# Running Quando

To run Quando, [follow these instructions](./docs/run_local.md)

# Using the Quando:Editor

You can open the Editor from the dashboard at [127.0.0.1](127.0.0.1) or by opening [127.0.0.1/editor](127.0.0.1/editor) in Chrome browser.


## Using the Quando:Client

After you have deployed scripts, you can open them from the dashboard at [127.0.0.1](127.0.0.1) or through [127.0.0.1/client](127.0.0.1/client) in Chrome browser, which will load the last script that was opened.  You can `right click the screen` to choose a different script to load.

### Updating Quando

Assuming you installed correctly, you can update quando, in a command line, in C:\quando, using:
```
git pull
```

### Optional - Leap Motion

To use the Leap Motion, the (not latest) Windows software v4.1.0+52211 must be installed on the Windows PC that will be the 'Client', i.e.  where the leap motion will be plugged in and the client interaction will be opened (in a web browser).  The software may be downloaded from [here](https://www2.leapmotion.com/v4.1-lmc-windows-sdk).  You will need to extract the contents, then run the 'Leap_Motion_Installer...' - you can uncheck 'Launch Browser for VR Setup'

After installing the Leap Motion Control Panel, the recommended settings are:
- Enable in General - disable everything else
  - Allow Web Apps **ESSENTIAL**
  - Robust Mode
  - Auto-orient Tracking
  - DISABLE Automatically Install Updates
- Enable in Troubleshooting
  - Low Resource Mode
  - Avoid Poor Performance

It is then advisable to plug in the Leap Motion and test it with the Diagnostic Visualizer - this can help identify lighting issues as well.

### Client browser Kiosk setup - allows PC to boot straight into client browser interaction

Follow [these instructions](./docs/setup_client_kiosk.md)

## Developing new Blocks

You should install Quando locally to develop new blocks.
